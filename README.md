# X-Publish

This tool packages up an [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com/) aircraft or scenery package folder into a cross-platform .zip archive for publication. This saves you from manually having to strip out unused files.

The tool archives only the required files (skipping source files e.g. Photoshop or Blender files) and produces a report listing which files it has included and warning about any missing files.

Runs on Windows 2000 or later, Mac OS 10.5 or later, and Linux.
